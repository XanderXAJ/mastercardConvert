MasterCard Currency Converter
=============================

Command line interface to MasterCard currency conversions.

It uses the currencies as can be found in the [MasterCard Currency Conversion Tool](https://www.mastercard.com/global/currencyconversion/index.html).

To use it, simply call the script with the amount you're converting, and the currency before and after.

For example, if I had paid 10 US Dollars and wanted to know how much that was in British Pound Sterling:

```shell
python mastercardConvert.py 10 USD GBP
```
